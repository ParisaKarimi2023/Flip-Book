# Flip-Book Web Application
The Flip-Book project is an interactive web application that simulates the experience of flipping pages in a physical book using digital technology. 
By incorporating animations, user interactions, and responsive design, the project provides an engaging way to present content such as books, magazines, portfolios,
or learning materials. This project demonstrates modern front-end development techniques and emphasizes user experience and visual realism.
